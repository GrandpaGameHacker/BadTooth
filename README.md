# BadTooth
Python Game Cheat Framework

# Development Goals
- Modular minimalistic design
- Interactive shell session
- Flexibility
- Scriptability
- Favour speed where possible (maybe put expensive code in c++ dll?)

# Early Prototype Dev Goals
- Implement Windows API using ctypes
- Each seperate by DLL e.g. kernel32.py
- A Wrapper accesses dll directly, e.g. memory.py
- Windows constants stored in its own module
